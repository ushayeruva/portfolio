      <h1>About</h1>
      <p> I'm passionate about using data and technology to further progressive causes. This interest stemmed from my time volunteering for progressive campaigns during high school and college. 
        In college, I started to cultivate an interest in statistics and data analytics, and began to look for compelling ways to combine this with my passion for making change on issues I care about. 
        I began looking for opportunities to work in data on campaigns and progressive organizations, and have really enjoyed my time in the field so far. I've started my professional career this January, and am excited to see where I will go from here. 
        I hope you'll get a better sense of my work and who I am through my portfolio!

      <p>
        I'm currently working as a Data Strategist at the National Domestic Workers Alliance, an advocacy organization committed to promoting the rights of domestic workers in the United States. 
        I primarily support the organization's membership data and tech needs. I'm graduating from the University of Michigan this semester where I studied Political Science and Information. College gave me the opportunity to combine my two seemingly disparate interests and find a way to put them together. 
        I really enjoyed all the data analytics courses I've gotten to take in the School of Information. Everything from Data-Oriented Programming to Machine Learning has helped me solidify my technical skills and be a real asset the campaigns and organizations I'll work at. 
        On the other side of things, my Political Science coursework has given me the tools to analyze the way in which I think about political situations and modern day politiical discourse.

        In my free time, I enjoy giving the New York Times crossword my best shot and trying to get into running. I ran track in high school and haven't really kept up with it, so always trying to get back into that. I also enjoy hiking. My family and I visit a different national park every summer. In the last couple of years, 
        we've been to Banff National Park, the Smoky Mountains, and Yellowstone. This summmer, I'm hoping to do a cross country train trip from Chicago to San Francisco, spend some time up north with my friends, and also visit a new national park. I'm excited to keep travelling and seeing different places around the world.
