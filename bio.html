            I’m passionate about leveraging my skills in data analytics and engineering to build systems that create change. While working on the Data & Analytics team at Lockwood Strategy Lab, I played a key role on ACRONYM’s voter registration program, a multi-million dollar digital campaign that registered and mobilized over 3 million young people of color in swing states. I wrote SQL code that glued together data from tools like LiveRamp and Segment with social media platforms like Facebook and Snapchat. This reporting infrastructure allowed us to analyze how users interacted with our site and if they completed down-funnel actions like registering to vote or returning their ballot. Building on that work, I created Periscope dashboards that displayed which ads were most effective and shared these results with our media and creative teams.

            With so many different data sources involved in this project, managing multiple engineering data pipelines was a top priority.  I oversaw 35 Civis jobs and wrote a Python script to check the status of all the jobs in the workflow daily. This job health infrastructure would automatically report failures and errors to the team. In addition, I built automated pipelines that moved data from Civis to Amazon S3 buckets and Google BigQuery warehouses to support external partners. 
          </p>

            I also led universe creation and list building for ACRONYM’s nationwide state legislative program. I collaborated with the political team to understand who this campaign should reach and used voter file attributes to define characteristics of the persuasion and mobilization universes we wanted to target. This million dollar digital ad campaign program ran on audience lists that I generated by writing SQL code and segmented according to the media team’s requests. Once the program began, I shifted my focus to creating Periscope ad transparency dashboards for the state tables, which allowed them to understand the spending levels of the campaigns they supported. I devised an automated system that queried Facebook and Google data to analyze how much candidates and organizations spent on targeted races. This work culminated in visualizations on Periscope dashboards that have contributed to industry knowledge of state legislature campaign spending on digital advertising.
